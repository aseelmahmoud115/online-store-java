# 🛒 Online Store System

This project is a Java-based console application that simulates a fully functional online shopping system. It demonstrates core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, along with practical use of collections for dynamic data management. The system allows users to interact with the store through a console menu, managing their shopping experience.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Product Management: Add, update, and remove products from the store's catalog.  
- Customer Registration: Register new customers and manage their personal information.  
- Shopping Cart: Add and remove items from the shopping cart, and view cart contents.  
- Checkout Process: Calculate total price, apply discounts, and generate a receipt.  
- Console Menu: Easy-to-navigate, menu-driven interface for interaction.  
- Data Persistence: Products and customers are stored dynamically using **ArrayList** for efficient management.  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- Java SE for the application development.  
- NetBeans IDE for development and testing.  
- Object-Oriented Programming principles to model the system.  
- Java Collections Framework (**ArrayList**) for managing products and customers.  
- **Scanner** class for capturing user input from the console.  

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run the Project
1. Clone or Download the repository to your local machine.  
2. Open the project in **NetBeans IDE**.  
3. Locate the `Main.java` file inside the `src` directory.  
4. Press **Shift + F6** to run the application.  
5. Follow the console instructions to interact with the online store system.  

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Integration with a database for persistent storage.  
- Implementation of an Admin Panel for managing the store’s products and users.  
- User authentication and login system.  
- Expand the shopping cart with features like order history and user preferences.
